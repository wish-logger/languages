# Welcome to the Wish Translation Hub!

This is the place where you can help make Wish more accessible around the world by contributing to our language support. Your efforts make a real difference for the community, and we're truly grateful for the impact you'll have!

## How can I get started?
Check out our Language Guide in the documentation:
üëâ [here!](https://docs.wishlogger.xyz/languages/start)
Everything you need to know is right there.

### When translating, please remember to:
- Make sure your translation is accurate and natural
- Keep the meaning and context clear
- Follow the required formatting!
- If you see any curly brackets like `{ }` with text inside (e.g., `{new_name}`), you should leave them untouched.
- Translations should always be based on the default language found in the `/languages/en_us` folder. This folder structure may receive updates or changes at any time, so make sure to join our support server to stay informed.
- Each language has its own folder containing multiple JSON files organized by category (base, generic, slash).
- Don't worry about settings files when creating a new language. Just make sure the folder name is correct ‚Äî for example, if you're creating a __Brazilian__ Portuguese translation, the folder should be named `br` in the languages directory.

### Folder Structure
For each language, please follow the folder structure below:
```
/languages/[language_code]/
  /base/           - Basic translation files
  /generic/        - Generic messages
  /slash/          - Slash command related translations
```

Want to introduce a new language that isn't listed yet? No problem! Just follow the "Contributing" section in the guide (soon).

Thanks again for being part of this ‚Äì and have fun translating! ‚ù§Ô∏è
