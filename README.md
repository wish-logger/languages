# Welcome to the Wish Translation Hub!

This is the place where you can help make Wish more accessible around the world by contributing to our language support. Your efforts make a real difference for the community, and we’re truly grateful for the impact you’ll have!

Everything you need to know is right there.

### When translating, please remember to:
- Make sure your translation is accurate and natural
- Keep the meaning and context clear
- Follow the required formatting!
- Don't translate emojis indicated by `<:Emoji_Name:ID>` — those emojis must remain in English. If you see any curly brackets like `{ }` with text inside (e.g., `{new_name}`), you should leave them untouched as well.
- Translations should always be based on the default language found in `languages/en_us.json`. This file may receive updates or changes at any time, so make sure to join our support server to stay informed. 

Want to introduce a new language that isn’t listed yet? No problem! Just follow the “Contributing” section in the guide (soon).

Thanks again for being part of this – and have fun translating! ❤️
